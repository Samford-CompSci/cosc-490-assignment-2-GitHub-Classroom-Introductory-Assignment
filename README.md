Starter course for assessing GitHub Classroom use.

The goal of this course is to introduce learners to using GiHub Classroom assignments and to assess that learners have the necessary skillset to complete a classroom assignment.

At the end of this course, learners will be able to:

1. describe what a GitHub Classroom assignment is and accept a GitHub Classroom assignment
1. use git to complete an assignment objective
1. use GitHub features to request feedback

## Classroom Assignments

GitHub Classroom is a tool that helps your lecturer / teacher orangize and manage GitHub repositories that are used for class exercises and assessments. GitHub Classroom automates repository creation and access control, making it easy to distribute starter code and collect assignments on GitHub.

A GitHub Classroom assignment is a GitHub repository with access control setup so both you and your leacturer / teacher can access it. When you accept an assignment, GitHub Classroom will automatically create a new repository for you. The assignment repository will belong to your course's organization account on GitHub, but you and your lecturer / teacher will have access to it.

Assignments can make use of GitHub features to:

- grade your work
- provide a mechanism to get feedback from your lecturer / teacher
- make commenting on code easier
- set a deadline for completion

Once an assignment has been accepted, students no longer interact with GitHub classroom. They just interact with GitHub.

## git and GitHub

In order to complete classroom assignments, you will need to be able to use git and be familiar with GitHub.

### git

Git is a software tool for tracking changes across a set of files. It helps programmers to undo changes that break their code and to work collaboratively with others when developing software.

If you are already family with using git, continue on. If you are new to using git, please complete the MS Learn course: [Introduction to Git](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-git/) before continuing.

### GitHub

GitHub is a cloud based service for hosting Git repositories. It provides a website, command-line tools, and workflow that makes it easier for developers and users to work together.

|:---|
| <p>Make a commit to this assignment repo.</p><p>Edit the [`editme.md`](../../edit/main/editme.md) file and add a question for your lecturer / teacher. When you have finished editing the file, save the changes and commit them to this repository.</p><p>You can either use the editing tools on GitHub to do this, or clone this repository to your local computer, make the changes, commit them and push the commit back to GitHub.</p> |

## Feedback Pull-Request

A pull request (PR) is a feature of GitHub and part of the GitHub flow. It provides a space and tools to review and discuss changes made on one branch before those changes are merged into another branch.

[Video: Introduction to pull requests](https://youtu.be/kJr-PIfLDl4)

Your lecturer / teacher might have setup a pull-request specifically for feedback. This PR will provide a place to see changes that you have made to the repo and a space for you to discuss with your lecturer / teacher the code that you have written.

| <img alt="activity status" align="right" height="24" src="../../blob/status/.github/activity-icons/activity3.svg" /> :clipboard: Activity - Comment on Feedback PR |
|:---|
| Go to the [Feedback pull request](../../pull/1). At the bottom of the page you will find a comment form. Leave a comment asking your lecturer / teacher to review your previous commit. |

## Knowledge Check

Complete the knowledge review quiz. There are five multiple choice questions on the topics covered in this course.

| <img alt="activity status" align="right" height="24" src="../../blob/status/.github/activity-icons/quiz.svg" /> :clipboard: Activity - Review quiz |
|:---|
| Edit the [`quiz.md`](../../edit/main/quiz.md) file and add your answers to each question on the same line as and after where it says 'Answer: '. When you have finished answering the questions, save the file, commit the changes and push your commit back to GitHub. |
